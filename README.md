# ExampleBungeecordLobby
An example Bungeecord lobby plugin with simple navigator and communication between servers

Notes:
- This plugin is by not necessarily the best way of doing this, it is merely for beginners as an example
- This plugin adds a simple navigator that connects to 2 other servers (the localized name is the name of the server set up in the bungeecord config.yml file)
- This plugin handles it's dependencies with maven, any differences in version should be reflected in your pom.xml when using it
